Project Title: USA City Brewery Database Search 

Description:
This web application provides an easy way to search for breweries in your city or for wherever you're traveling!  The application will display breweries based on the Open Brewery DB API (see link to API here: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).  After searching for a particular USA city, the results will display the following information: brewery name, brewery website link, brewery address, and the brewery type.  After the search city is entered, each brewery's information is displayed on a card and the card is highlighted when the mouse hovers over it.

This is my Phase 1 JavaScript Project for Flatiron School.
